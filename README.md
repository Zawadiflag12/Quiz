# Quiz
 
## Description
This project is a quiz with some back end testing added to it. The testing consists of e2e and component testing. 

## Installation
```
npm i to install the node package models. Then npm run build to build the back end and npm run seed to seed the database. Finally npm run start:dev to run the program. Once the program is running you need to open a second terminal. Once the secoond termainal is open then run npm run cypress. Once in cypress then you can enter e2e testing or component testing. I have also attached a walkthrough video for assistance.
